   <p1 style="color:darkblue;background-color:white;font-size:20px;font-family: Edu AU VIC WA NT Hand, cursive;">It's artificial intelligence because artificial intelligence is interesting and fascinating, because it defines the field of computer science dedicated to solving problems typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, creativity, and image recognition.</p1>
      
      <h1 style="color:blue;font-size:30px;font-family: Edu AU VIC WA NT Hand, cursive;"> Topics I want to learn more about </h1> 
   
   <p1 style="color:darkblue;font-size:20px;background-color:white;font-family: Edu AU VIC WA NT Hand, cursive;">It is programming because it is amazing and full of wonders, and it is what creates artificial intelligence, and there are more than 9 thousand programming languages, and the programming languages include JavaScript, HTML/Css, Python, and Java. The best programming language for me is Python because it is easy, simple, and readable

      <h1 style="color:blue;font-size:30px;font-family: Edu AU VIC WA NT Hand, cursive;"> Topics I thought were difficult </h1> 
   
   <p1 style="color:darkblue;font-size:20px;background-color:white;font-family: Edu AU VIC WA NT Hand, cursive;">It's the networks because they're big, they're vast, they're full of information, and they require good concentration. I will try to learn it well and Allah willing, I will be able to understand and study it well</p1>
